Method:Time-Based:Employ timers and events for animation.
## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
I was inspired by Elias Hanzer’s Phase, which uses modular, generative shapes that shift rhythmically over time. I want to apply this time-based progression to my project by using simple forms that move or transform gradually. This technique helps me express change and repetition without user input. It fits the assignment’s focus on time-based animation and allows me to explore a clean, structured, and rhythmic visual language.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
I found that using millis() in p5.js is an effective way to control rhythmic modular transformations over time. This function tracks how much time has passed since the program started, allowing me to trigger shape changes or motion at consistent intervals. This timed triggering helps simulate the structured rhythm seen in Phase. It also separates animation from user input, making the system fully time-based. By using millis() to control when events happen, I can build animations that express flow, repetition, and progression in a clean and modular visual language.
